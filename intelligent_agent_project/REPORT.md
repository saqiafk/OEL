_Date: 2025-09-02_

## Title
Development of a Data-Driven Intelligent Agent Using Machine Learning on a Real-World Dataset

## Objective
Build an intelligent system that learns to classify medical samples (benign vs malignant)
and recommends a follow-up action.

## Motivation
Early, reliable classification can prioritize medical attention efficiently and support decision-making.

## Concept
- Supervised learning (binary classification) with a tree-ensemble model (Random Forest).
- Agent encapsulates the model + action policy.

## Problem Statement
Given numeric features extracted from cell nuclei images, predict class (benign/malignant) and provide a
recommended action.

## Design / Ways & Means
- **Introduction & Requirements**: Python 3.10+, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
- **Data Structure Selection**: Pandas DataFrame/Series; sklearn Pipeline for transformations and modeling.
- **Basic Implementation**: Preprocessing (scaling), RandomForestClassifier, train/validation split.
- **Performance Testing & Analysis**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC; confusion matrix; ROC curve.
- **Optimization & Advanced Features**: Tunable hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth).
- **Extensions & Creativity**: Action mapping, model persistence, CLI interface.

## Background / Theory
Tree ensembles reduce variance and capture nonlinear feature interactions; ROC-AUC summarizes ranking quality.

## Procedure / Methodology
1. Load dataset via `sklearn.datasets`.
2. Split into train/test (stratified).
3. Build preprocessing pipeline (scaler) + classifier.
4. Train; evaluate on hold-out set.
5. Save model; generate visualizations.
6. Wrap into an agent with `decide()` for inference + action.

## Data Collection
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (as distributed by scikit-learn).

                                     Agent(decide) -> Predict -> Action
```

## Analysis
See `outputs/reports/evaluation.json` after running `python -m ai_agent.cli train`.

## Results
The report includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix,
and figures: ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importances.

## Discussion on Results
High ROC-AUC indicates strong separability; feature importances highlight key predictors.
Consider calibration or alternative models if probability estimates must be well-calibrated.

## Concluding Remarks
The agent shows robust performance and a clean interface for deployment or further research.
Future work: model selection grid search, probability calibration, and explainability (SHAP).
